<p><stage>ACT I </stage></p>
<p><stage>SCENE--Main room of the headquarters of the International Workers Union in Hoboken--a large bare room with white-washed walls. In the rear, two windows looking out on a dingy back street. On the wall between the windows, a large framed engraving of a naked woman with a liberty cap on her head, leaning back against the two upright beams of a guillotine. In the left hand corner, a desk with chair. In the middle of left wall, a door opening into hall. In right corner, a small table with typewriter on it. In the middle of left wall, a door opening into hall. In the middle of right wall, another door. In the center of room, a long table with four or five straight-backed chairs placed around it. On the table, newspapers, periodicals, stacks of pamphlets, etc. Flooring of coarse, uncovered boards. Framed cartoons, mostly in color, from Jugend, Simplissimus, etc., are hung here and there on the walls. </stage></p>
<p><stage>It is evening and already dark. Two gas lights of the Welsbach type, fixed on the tarnished chandelier which hangs over the table, throw a cold white light about the room, revealing every detail of its bare ugliness. </stage></p>
<p><stage>Olga stands at one end of the table reading a newspaper. She is very dark; strong, fine features; large spirited black eyes, slender, supple figure. Enwright sits on the chair nearest her. He is thin, round-shouldered, middle-aged, clean-shaven, wears glasses.</stage></p>

    <Sptext> He's been a second engineer on the boats of the Ocean Steamship company ever since I can remember. That fact gives you a glimpse into his character.

Instead they will probably adopt harsh retaliatory measures. The strike will break out and it will be a fight to the finish. </Sptext>

<p><stage>ACT II </stage></p>
<p><stage>SCENE--Sitting-room of Thomas Perkins' small home in jersey City--a small room crowded with cheap furniture. On the right, two windows with drawn shades and stiff white curtains. In the right corner, a sofa. In the middle of rear wall, a door leading into the hall. On the right of door, a bookcase half filled with a few books and stacks of magazines. In the left corner, a stand on which is a potted rubber plant. In the left wall, forward, a door. Ugly straight-backed chairs are pushed back against the walls which are papered in some dreary floral design. </stage></p>
<p><stage>It is about nine o'clock on the same night. Thomas Perkins and Henderson are discovered at the table playing cards. Perkins is a nervous, self-conscious, awkward little man with a soft timid voice. He is half bald but an unkempt fringe of thin grey hair straggles about his ears. He wears spectacles, carpet slippers, ill-fitting shabby clothes. Henderson is a tall, lean Scotchman with grey hair and bristly mustache. He is dressed in the uniform of a ship's engineer. </stage></p>
<p><stage>They are just finishing a hand at euchre. Henderson is fiercely intent upon the game, agleam of triumph in his eye. Perkins pays but little attention to his cards but continually glances at the door in rear. His manner is worried, his expression troubled, and evidently his playing is ragged in the extreme for Henderson grunts with contemptuous satisfaction as he rakes in the tricks.</stage></p>

<p><stage>ACT III </stage></p>
<p><stage>SCENE I</stage></p>
<p><stage>SCENE--A section of the firemen's forecastle on the S.S. San Francisco at dock in Liverpool--two weeks or so later. Bunks, ranged three deep with a space of two and a half to three feet between them, occupy the rear and left walls. Over the upper tier of bunks in rear, several open portholes. In front of the bunks, low wooden benches. In under the lower tier a glimpse can be had of seachests, suit cases, etc. jammed in indiscriminately. In the middle of right wall, a door. On either side of it, more tiers of bunks. A row of steel stanchions extends down the middle of the room. Everything is steel, painted white, except the board floor. </stage></p>
<p><stage>It is night. As the curtain rises, the ship's bell is heard ringing four bells. </stage></p>
<p><stage>A number of stokers are seated on the benches or lying in their bunks, the majority smoking clay pipes. Most of them are either stripped to the waist or in their undershirts, for the smoke-laden air in the forecastle on this August night is stiflingly hot. Tom is seated in their midst, smoking a cigarette, staring moodily before him. </stage></p>

<p><stage>SCENE--A private room in a hospital in Liverpool--three weeks or so later. A dazzlingly-white, sunshiny room with a large, open, white-curtained window in the middle of left wall. Near the window, a rocking chair with cushions and a wicker table. In the rear, a white iron bed placed so that its occupant faces the audience. To the right of bed, a door. On the left of bed, a small stand with glass shelves on which are medicine bottles, glasses, etc. Two straight-backed chairs stand against the right wall. </stage></p>
<p><stage>Tom is discovered sitting in the rocking chair, gazing out of the window with listless, half-closed eyes. His head is bandaged and his face is pale and thin. He wears a light colored bathrobe over his pajamas, and slippers. </stage></p>
